#Maturation and Spawning induction Genes.
<right>M. A. del Rio.</right>


## Introduction
Two of the biggest problems in a genetic breeding program are the induction to maturation and to spawn. Most of the organisms do not mature under culture condition. If mature adults are found, many are induce to spawn. But not all organisms actually spawn. So the geneticist have to work with the organisms that spawn at the same time, so there is no a proper planning in crosses. 
Regulating genes (hormones?) that could induce maturation and spawning could help to geneticist to have a better plan for crossing in a genetic breeding program.
